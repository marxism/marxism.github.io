# Mission Statement

The potential for software to empower the international working class movement
is vast; it's time we tapped into it. ProleSoft intends to organise
working class software developers in pursuit of this goal.

### How to Join Our Matrix Channel

_Matrix_ is an open network for secure, decentralized communication. It operates a little differently, and admittedly
with a little more complexity, than most instant messaging services. However, it is open source and far more secure than
any privately-owned communication system you might have used in the past, and we feel that this makes utilising it worth it
for our purposes. Joining the channel (which is what Matrix calls a chat-room or group) can appear confusing if you aren't
familiar with the platform. You can always refer back to this guide when trying to figure it out.

#### Instructions

When you click on the [Join the chat on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!TUENHHyVTWHKRxKiSm:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) link
above, you'll be brought to a page that looks like this:

Click on the link surrounded by a red square in the screenshot to join our channel through an app called Riot. You'll
be asked to make an account, and once you do you'll be able to log in on the riot desktop app, website, or mobile apps.
That's all there really is to it!

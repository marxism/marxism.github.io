When we refer to _basic_ website development, we're talking about the creation
of simple websites that don't do much other than providing information in an
accessible way. At their core, the most simple websites exist solely for this
reason. Now that so many working class people have internet access, information
is most accessible to the widest range of working class people through the
internet. Designing a simple and easy-to-navigate website is the most effective
way to communicate information to normal people using the internet, who would
rather not sift through long PDF documents or go to physical locations to
receive information.

Of course, not all websites are as simple as that. Some websites we use all the
time, like [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [Netflix](https://netflix.com), and
[PayPal](https://paypal.com) are different from the kind of website described
above. This is because they do more than just provide information, they provide
_interactive functionality_. And those interactive functionalities can get quite
complex. Netflix, for example, has to store many terabytes of high quality
video, and its website has to provide a way for users to:

* Sign up and pay for a subscription if they don't have an account
* Log in if they _do_ have an account
* Access the many terabytes of video they have stored
* Keep track of a user's "list," their progress in various shows and films, and
  their preferences
* Display an easy to use User Interface that organises videos by genre, as well
  as differentiating between shows and films

and much more. This goes far beyond what we mean by basic website development,
but it does fall under what we consider web _application_ development, which
you're going to learn eventually! But learning how to make simple sites is the
best way to start our journey, and it's not entirely unexciting! This website
can be considered a "simple" website, often referred to as a _static_ site.
Being able to build static sites is an incredibly useful skill that's made our
lives easier at ProleSoft.

## How to Learn

* [Codecademy: Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website) (sign-up required)
    - An interactive explanatory course in basic website development that runs
      entirely in your browser.
* [w3schools: HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) + [w3schools: CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
    - The classic interactive HTML resource and reference. Get comfortable with
      it, because you'll be going back to it whenever you forget something about
      HTML, CSS, and much more. Less strict and hand-holding than Codecademy.

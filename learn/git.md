[Version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) is using
software to manage your code in a way that allows you to travel back and forth
in time and collaborate with other developers without causing too many
conflicts. There are many current and historical version control programs, but
by far the most popular is [Git](https://git-scm.com/), frequently used together
with an online hosting platform for codebases (called `repositories`),
[GitHub](https://github.com/).

installing software, though, you can learn online without ever opening a
terminal. With the resources below, you can learn to track files, work with

The initiative to develop software for the advancement of the working class movement only stands to benefit
from enabling more leftists to develop and work with open-source software. We would love to see more leftists
take up software and would be relieved to have more hands contributing to our many projects, so we
are more than happy to give as much guidance as possible to those who are here to learn.

The order you probably want to follow in learning the various skills that go into software development might look
something like:

1. Basic Website Development
1. Scripting
1. Command Line Interface
1. Version Control Systems
1. Persistent Data Solutions
1. Web Application Development
1. DevOps

The initiative to develop software for the advancement of the working class
movement only stands to benefit from enabling more leftists to develop and work
with open-source software. We would love to see more leftists take up software
and would be relieved to have more hands contributing to our many projects, so
we are more than happy to give as much guidance as possible to those who are
here to learn.

The order you probably want to follow in learning the various skills that go
into software development might look something like this:

1. [Basic Website Development (HTML, CSS)](/learn/basic-web-dev)
1. [Scripting (JavaScript, Python)](/learn/scripting)
1. [Command Line Interface (Terminal, Shell/Bash)](/learn/cli)
1. [Version Control Systems (Git)](/learn/git)
1. Persistent Storage (Databases, SQL, Caches)
1. Web Application/App Development (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, Swift, Kotlin)
1. [DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform)](/learn/devops)
1. [Specialised Programming (Data Science, Systems Programming, Pure Functional
   Languages, etc.)](/learn/advanced)

Any one of these topics can take months or years to master, and not all of them
are necessary to contribute to projects or get a career in the software
industry.

DevOps is the practice of integrating traditional systems administration with
modern development practices. In practice, this means developers learning to
test, build, and run their code, while operations engineers learn to write
scripts, automate away more annoying tasks, and contribute small code changes.

We're not going to go deep on operations, because that's a whole broad topic
that only sometimes intersects with development. Networking, security, hardware,
data centers: all of these and more are the responsibility of traditional
operations engineers, and are worth learning separately if any of them pique
your interest.

## How to Learn

DevOps tools and practices are best learned by using them. There's no single
article or book you can read that will make you comfortable with everything. At
this point you should be comfortable with finding up-to-date material online, so
here is a list of some major topics to read about:

* Agile methodology and Scrum
* Automated acceptance and load testing
* Continuous integration, delivery, and deployment (CI/CD/CD)
* Cloud Providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
* Virtual machines (VMs)
* Containerization (Docker)
* Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
* Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
* Telemetry (Monitoring, Logging, Alerting, Observability)
* Database Administration
* Ops vs DevOps vs SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)

Don't feel daunted by the scope of these topics. If DevOps interests you, you
can and probably will learn about all of these eventually. If it doesn't
interest you, there's no need to go deep on anything in the above list, just
being familiar with some of the terminology will already put you ahead of many
developers.

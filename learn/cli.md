The command line seems formidible at first, but with a few weeks of practice,
you may find yourself moving faster and more comfortably than when using
graphical applications. Everything you do in a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
can be done with a few commands, usually much more efficiently: watching videos,
listening to music, sending Tweets, opening files, and of course writing and
manipulating code.

Generally speaking, command line tools are standardized and portable (what works
on one computer will work on another) in Unix-like environments (Linux, BSD, and
Mac OS). The default Windows command line experience is non-standard, but
fortunately you can install a Unix-like environment in Windows (see links
below).

## How to Learn

If you are using Linux, BSD, or Mac OS, you already have everything you need at
your disposal. On Mac, open Terminal.app from Spotlight. On Linux and BSD, open
your distribution's terminal application.

If you're on Windows, you'll need to install some extra software:

* Windows 10: [install WSL](https://wsl-guide.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/installation.html)
* Other versions: install the latest release of [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)

You can also learn online without installing or configuring any extra software
[here](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/ubuntu/playground).

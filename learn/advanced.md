Now that you've covered such a broad range of topics, you might want to find a
specialisation. There are all sorts of focused areas you could get into, such as
[becoming a DBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_administrator), learning
[pure functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming),
[systems programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming),
and [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) (just to name a
few). We can't offer resources on all of these topics, but investigate, ask
yourself what you enjoy and don't enjoy, and try a little bit of everything! At
this point you are probably good and directing your learning yourself, and know
where to look for answers.

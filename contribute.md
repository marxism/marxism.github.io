### What Does it Mean to Contribute?

In the world of open-source software, it is commonplace even for complete strangers to make improvements, fixes or
adjustments to the software whose source code you publish online. This is a core benefit of open-source software: the
people who use and/or take interest in your software are always in the position to put their time towards improving it
or adjusting it to their liking. If their preferences and changes don't match your vision for the software you wrote,
they have the opportunity to easily make their own _version_ of your software with the changes they would like to see,
leaving your software untouched.

Contributing to open-source software is a process consisting of:

1. Downloading the software's source code
1. Reading the software's documentation and engaging with its community or lead developers to understand how the code works
1. Identifying a problem, potential feature or change you might like to see
1. Starting a conversation with the community and/or lead developers about the change, whether others would appreciate it, and what it would take to make it a reality
1. Editing and experimenting with the code, either alone or with others, in an attempt to implement the change successfully
1. Returning to the conversation table when you reach dead-ends or difficult errors

### How to Contribute to Our Code

We host our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/prolesoft), with a read-only
[Gitea mirror](https://yerbamate.dev/prolesoft). To get started, you'll need an
account on GitHub, and if you're unfamiliar with contributing to open-source
software, you should check out our [learning documentation](/learn).

### How to Join Our Matrix Channel

_Matrix_ is an open network for secure, decentralized communication. It operates a little differently, and admittedly
with a little more complexity, than most instant messaging services. However, it is open source and far more secure than
any privately-owned communication system you might have used in the past, and we feel that this makes utilising it worth it
for our purposes. Joining the channel (which is what Matrix calls a chat-room or group) can appear confusing if you aren't
familiar with the platform. You can always refer back to this guide when trying to figure it out.

#### Instructions

When you click on the [Join the chat on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!TUENHHyVTWHKRxKiSm:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) link
above, you'll be brought to a page that looks like this:

Click on the link surrounded by a red square in the screenshot to join our channel through an app called Riot. You'll
be asked to make an account, and once you do you'll be able to log in on the Riot desktop app, website, or mobile apps.
That's all there really is to it!
